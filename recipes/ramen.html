    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Chicken Tonkotsu ramen (豚骨ラーメン) is a ramen dish
        that originated in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture on
        the Kyushu island of Japan, and it is a speciality
        dish in both Fukuoka and Kyushu. The soup broth is
        based on chicken bones and other ingredients, which 
        are typically boiled for several hours, and the dish
        is traditionally topped with chicken and served with
        ramen noodles that are hard in the center.
        In Fukuoka, Japan, tonkotsu ramen is referred to as
        Hakata ramen.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 pounds chicken </li>
        <li> Ramen noodles </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li> 1 large onion, roughly chopped </li>
        <li> 12 garlic cloves </li>
        <li> ginger, roughly chopped </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce </li>
        <li> 2 whole leeks </li>
        <li> 1/4th cup sesame oil </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon salt </li>
        <li> 2 dozen scallions </li>
        <li> 6 ounces whole mushrooms </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Bring a kettle full of water to a boil. Lay the
            wing tips and chicken bones in a clean sink,
            then pour the boiling water over the chicken.
            Wash the chicken with cold water, scrubbing
            off any clumps of blood. This step solidifies
            some of the blood on the chicken so you can
            wash it off and it doesn't end up in your soup.</li>
        <li> In a small saucepan, add the leeks, ginger and
            garlic, then cover with vegetable oil. Gently 
            fry over medium low heat until the aromatics 
            are dark brown, but not burnt (about 30-40 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the kombu, wingtips and bones to a pressure
            cooker and cover with 10 cups of water. Bring
            it to a boil uncovered, then skim off the scum
            that floats to the top. Continue skimming until
            you don't see any more scum. Remove the kombu
            and discard. Drain the fried leeks, ginger and
            garlic and add them to the pressure cooker. </li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and seal the lid on the pressure
            cooker. Set the pressure to high and the bring
            the cooker up to pressure over high heat
            (you should hear whistling). Turn down the 
            temperature until there's a gentle whistling
            sound coming from the pressure regulator. 
            If it's hissing violently your heat is up too
            high, if you don't hear anything your heat 
            is down too low. Cook for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>When the stock is done cooking, let it cool to
            room temperature. Pour it through a large 
            strainer into a large bowl. Squeeze the solids
            with your hands to extract as much liquid as
            possible. You'll notice that the liquid starts
            turning a creamy white. This is what gives
            the soup its body so be sure you get every
            last drop. Pour the strained soup through
            an extra fine sieve (such as a tea strainer)
            into a clean container. You can either
            stop here and refrigerate the stock or 
            keep going.</li>
        <li>If you refrigerated the stock, it should be fairly easy to scrape off the excess fat with a spoon. If not, use a fat skimmer to skim off the extra fat and set the fat aside. In either case, you want to leave a little fat behind. Measure your the soup. You should have about 6 cups, if you have more, you should boil it down to 6 cups, if you have less, add water.</li>
        <li>To make the caramelized scallion oil, add the sesame oil along with about 2 tablespoons of chicken fat that you've skimmed from the soup to a small saucepan. Put the saucepan over medium heat, then add the minced scallions. Fry the scallions until they are medium to dark brown in color. Turn off the heat, then carefully add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. The oil will sputter, so be very careful. This caramelizes the soy sauce, giving it a wonderful toasty aroma.</li>
        <li>To make the soup, add the 6 cups of strained stock to a pot, add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of salt, and the soy milk and gently heat.</li>
        <li>Boil your noodles according to the package directions or make a batch of homemade ramen noodles.</li>
        <li>To finish the ramen divide the noodles between four bowls, pour the soup over the noodles then top with your choice of toppings. I served this with a soft boiled egg, menma, shredded scallions, and chicken chashu, but what you top it with is up to you. Boil your noodles according to the package directions. Put the boiled noodles in the bowl and add the toppings. Cover with the hot soup, then drizzle on some of the caramelized scallion oil. Serve immediately.</li>
